          You’ll be required to sign two transactions — one to request to
          register, and the other to actually register.

        <p className="metamask-content">
          Click on the “request to register” button, you’ll get a push
          notification from your wallet to confirm this transaction.
        </p>
        <p className="metamask-content">
          Here, you’ll notice a small network fee. You can adjust the amount to
          pay depending on how quickly you want the transaction to get
          fulfilled, the wallet app will usually suggest an estimate that you
          can go with.

          Most wallets allow you to select amounts for a “slow🐌, normal⏱ or
          fast🚀” transaction. The more money you’re willing to spend, the
          faster your transaction will be.
        </p>
        <p className="metamask-content">
          Once you approve the transaction, it will be submitted on the
          blockchain, and you’ll wait for it to be confirmed.
        </p>
        <p className="metamask-content">
          Once your transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain, you’ll be
          required to wait for one minute to ensure that someone else hasn’t
          tried to register that name within the same period. If this checks
          out, you’ll be able to initiate the second transaction by clicking
          “Register”.
        </p>
        <p className="metamask-content">
          You’ll get another notification from your wallet to sign the
          transaction. This time, you’ll see the cost of the ENS name, as well
          as the network fee.
        </p>
        <p className="metamask-content">
          Once this transaction is confirmed, you now own the ENS name and will
          be able to see it as a collectible in your wallet.
