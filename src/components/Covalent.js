</h2>
<p className="metamask-content" >Block explorers are one of the most important tools in a crypto enthusiast’s arsenal. They provide an online interface for searching a blockchain, and enable you to retrieve data about transactions, addresses, blocks, fees, and more. Each block explorer provides data about a particular blockchain, and the type of information included will vary depending on the architecture of the blockchain it serves.

You can use a block explorer to check the status of a transaction if you’re buying or selling crypto. You can also acquire information associated with your blockchain address, including your transaction history, the total value of the assets held at the address, the total amount of crypto received at the address, and the total amount of crypto sent from the address, among other data points.
